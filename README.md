# SRD GUI

## Description

The simultaneous stimulation-and-recording device (SRD) is a Bluetooth wireless brain-computer interface system designed for use in awake rats. This repository contains the graphical user interface (GUI) for controlling the SRD. The GUI was developed using MS Visual Studio 2010 in C#.

### Features
- programmable analog and digital filters
- variable acquisition settings (sample rate, channel count, etc.)
- variable stimulator parameters (amplitudes, duration, bi/mono phasic, etc.)
- stimulator calibration
- live view of acquired signals
- store signals to file and review later
- multiple operating modes
    - off
	- automatic (stim and rec)
	- continuous streaming
	- trigger stim from external IR signal
	- trigger rec from external IR signal
	- look-ahead triggered recording
